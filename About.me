Token-priced, verified local leads — pay only for quality.

Bio
I’m building a lead marketplace that pays providers based on what actually matters: real customer intent and real revenue. Campaigns are funded on-chain (Solana escrow), while leads are verified off-chain using opt-in CRM data, booking confirmations, and anti-fraud checks.

What it does
	•	Buyers create a “Lead Campaign” with a budget and a base payout per lead
	•	Workers claim campaigns and submit leads through email, secure forms, SMS, or calls
	•	Leads are automatically verified for locality + non-datacenter IP, then scored from CRM outcomes
	•	Payout is dynamic: 0.00–1.00x multiplier based on lead quality (booking + dollars spent)

Integrations
	•	Fieldd (booking + confirmations)  ￼
	•	Twilio (SMS + calls with signed webhooks)  ￼
	•	HubSpot + Zapier templates for quick CRM setup  ￼

Trust & verification
	•	IP reputation checks (VPN/proxy/hosting detection)  ￼
	•	Local radius check (100 miles) using IP geolocation (best-effort)  ￼
	•	On-chain escrow + payouts for transparency
